    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Python variables are used to store values. Each variable has a data type. Common basic data types that come with the original Python are Booleans, Integers, Floats, Lists, Strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Booleans is a data type that can only store two states --- True or False\n",
    "- Integers are normal numbers --- -10, -4, 0, 49\n",
    "- Floats are real numbers --- -2.39, 0.42, 1009023.1\n",
    "- Lists are a sequence of other objects --- [True, -19, 0.32, False]\n",
    "- Strings are texts = sequences of characters --- 'this is a string'\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other data types which we don't need in this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names should be lower-cased, can not start with a number and can not contain special characters (just don't use anything funky and you will be fine).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the function `print` which outputs the stored values to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the function `type` which returns the data type of the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "`print` in combination with `type` allows you to output the type of a variable."

    "\n",
    "In the previous exercises you most likely tried something which didn't work at the first try. The reason can be twofold: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. That you programmed something which runs from the interpreter perspective (it doesn't crash) but yields a wrong result. These mistakes are particularly painful to find. For me it helps to go through the code line by line and simply `print` the values of variables. Using this technique you quickly see at which point a wrong value is stored in a variable. This is also the main reason why we later pick Pytorch over Tensorflow as Pytorch allows to always `print` the values of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The interpreter threw an error. This happens if you want to execute a line of code which doesn't make sense/is illegal in Python. Examples can be\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = 2 + 'hallo'\n",
    "b = [1, 2, 3] + 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python is very good in describing its errors. The first line throws \n",
    "```\n",
    "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "In these cases, closely read the error message. There is also always a line number shown. So go to the line number and try to figure out what happens based on the error message. Are you dividing by zero? Are there data types that you didn't want?\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two things usually take 90% of the time spent programming. In the beginning, each error message is a pain and it takes long to fix it. After a while you have seen many things and already know what is going on before you even looked at the line the error is thrown."
